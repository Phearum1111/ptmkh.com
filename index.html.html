            <h2>Who?</h2>
            <p> Eventually, the clearing of Phnom Tamao forest land was canceled after a direct order from Prime Minister Hun Sen. The people expressed their applause for this decision. But what lies ahead is the sadness that thousands of forests have been cut down under development. According to the people, even replanting takes a long time and can not be the same.</p>
